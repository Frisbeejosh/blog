<p>Well, folks, <strong>we are back to standard time</strong>. My joyous
time shooting at F16 is <em>out the window</em>, and now I must resort
to metaphorically popping people. <strong>The flash is all I
have</strong>, and thus, I have shifted from street journalism to street
landscapes. Check out some of my work below! I have been shooting an
absurd amount of film, but <em>thankfully</em>, I develop my film at the
<a href="https://www.thesoilfactory.org/">soil factory</a> and scan the
negatives with a flatbed scanner in mann library on the weekends!</p>
