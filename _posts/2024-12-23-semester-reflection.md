<h3>Well folks, the semester just wrapped up last week. Another one in
the books! It is wild that I am going into my fourth semester in my PhD.
I have learned a lot and wanted to reflect on the things that have stuck
with me:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Burn out will happen, with that said, when you are in the flow,
seize the day!!!</p></li>
<li><p>tackle the hardest things (either mentally or time wise) on your
to-do list at the begining of the day, then when you are tired later in
the day, cruise on the busy items</p></li>
<li><p>PhDs are marathons, not races. Spend lots of time just thinking!
While it might feel like wasted time, these moments spent are where I
have seen the most growth in my research</p></li>
</ul>
