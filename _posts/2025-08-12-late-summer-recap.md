summer is starting to come to a close - I feel the energy of the townies
preparing for all of the undergrads to come back. I also am feeling that
sentiment. Anyways, looking back on the summer, I had the pleasure of
finally submitting my rotation project for publication <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.09.663802v1">check
out the preprint here</a>.

<p>I also just got back from the <a
href="http://2025.botanyconference.org">BOTANY</a> conference where I
presented a poster titled <em>The power to resolve relationships:
identifying incongruence and precision of reduced representation and
genome-wide data in phylogenomics and population genomics</em> and a
presentation titled <em>A Model for the Evolutionary Dynamics of Dioecy
in Catopsis Griseb. (Bromeliaceae)</em></p>
