There are many days where I as a botanist do not think I will ever be as famous actors become (or even zoologists for that matter). No matter how hard [botany baller](https://www.instagram.com/botany.baller/?hl=en) tries, even if he were to get timberwolves courtside seats, nobody would care about a damn botanist like they would about my mans timothee chalamet.  

Anyways, the class act davey, a lad i am grateful to call my friend reminded me that it has been a minute since i have written something on my blog.  

Many of things have happened in the past months since the dark dog days of february. First and foremost, I am now a [PhD candidate!](https://blogs.cornell.edu/specht/2025/05/30/justin-and-josh-advance-to-candidacy/) Whilst a stressful time preparing for the exam, I have left with curiosity and drive that I am cultivating.  

This is the first post of many in the coming week/weeks. I hope to share some results from the various projects I am working on as well as my [musical](https://soundcloud.com/teaman97) and photographic pursuits.
