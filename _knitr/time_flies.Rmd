### Well folks, it has been a minute since I have posted here. Things are going well here in Ithaca. I am taking (advanced pop gen)[https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP25/class/BIOCB/6910] with (April Wei)[https://aprilweilab.github.io/]

### The class has been incredibly theroetical so far which has thrown me for a loop but I am enjoying pushing my horizions!

### Soon we will be applying the equations to real life scenerios and running forward and backward simulations which I am looking forward to!

### I am looking forward to warm weather... most posts (and simulations!) on the way
