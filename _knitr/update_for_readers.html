<p>There are many days where I as a botanist do not think I will ever be
as famous actors become (or even zoologists for that matter). No matter
how hard <a href="https://www.instagram.com/botany.baller/?hl=en">botany
baller</a> tries, even if he were to get timberwolves courtside seats,
nobody would care about a damn botanist like they would about my mans
timothee chalamet.</p>
<p>Anyways, the class act davey, a lad i am grateful to call my friend
reminded me that it has been a minute since i have written something on
my blog.</p>
<p>Many of things have happened in the past months since the dark dog
days of february. First and foremost, I am now a <a
href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/specht/2025/05/30/justin-and-josh-advance-to-candidacy/">PhD
candidate!</a> Whilst a stressful time preparing for the exam, I have
left with curiosity and drive that I am cultivating.</p>
<p>This is the first post of many in the coming week/weeks. I hope to
share some results from the various projects I am working on as well as
my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/teaman97">musical</a> and
photographic pursuits.</p>
