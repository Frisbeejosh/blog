<p>There are many days where I as a botanist do not think I will ever be
as famous actors become (or even zoologists for that matter). No matter
how hard botany baller tries, even if he were to get timberwolves
courtside seats, nobody would care about a damn botanist like they would
about my mans timotee chalemet.</p>
<p>Anyways, the class act davey, a lad i am greatful to call my friend
reminded me that it has been a minute since i have written something on
my blog.</p>
<p>Many of things have happened in the past months since the dark dog
days of feburary. First and foremorst, I am now a PhD canidate! Whilst a
stressful time preparing for the exam, I have left with curisoty and
drive that I am cultivating.</p>
<p>This is the first post of many in the coming week/weeks. I hope to
share some results from the various projects I am working on as well as
my musical and photographic pursuits.</p>
