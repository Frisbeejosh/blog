### Well folks, the semester just wrapped up last week. Another one in the books! It is wild that I am going into my fourth semester in my PhD. I have learned a lot and wanted to reflect on the things that have stuck with me:

- Burn out will happen, with that said, when you are in the flow, seize the day!!!
  
- tackle the hardest things (either mentally or time wise) on your to-do list at the begining of the day, then when you are tired later in the day, cruise on the busy items
  
- PhDs are marathons, not races. Spend lots of time just thinking! While it might feel like wasted time, these moments spent are where I have seen the most growth in my research

### I am looking forward to the new year... most posts on the way
